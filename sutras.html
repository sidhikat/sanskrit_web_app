      <p >The following concept is a fundamental building block of Sanskrit grammar and its
      codification. Without it, Pāṇini could not have written his Aṣṭādhyāyī the way he did. Its
      origin story is also important to know, so let us start there. The following story is a
      retelling of the story that is told about Pāṇini within the vyākaraṇa tradition.</p>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in a city called Takṣaśilā (modern day: Taxila, Punjab, Pakistan),
        there lived a boy who was a fool. He grew up hearing about his own foolishness and
        that he would never amount to anything. Somehow, he got into the university in
        Takṣaśilā, which was a well-known center of education. There, he studied Sanskrit
        grammar (vyākaraṇa). Even at the university, he was called a fool, and one day he got
        fed up with this designation. He went to the forest to perform austerities and to beseech
        Lord Śiva to bestow intelligence upon him. Śiva was pleased with his austerity, and
        started to dance. While dancing, he played his instrument, the ḍamaru, 14 times. When
        he played his instrument, to a normal ear, it sounded like “takatakatakataka”. But to
        Pāṇini’s ears, which were tuned to the subject of Sanskrit vyākaraṇa, it sounded like:
      </p>

    <ul>
      <li>  अ इ उ ण्</li>
      <li> ऋ ऌ क्</li>
      <li>ए ओ ङ्</li>
      <li>ऐ औ च्</li>
      <li>ह य व र ट्</li>
      <li>ल ण्</li>
      <li>ञ म ङ ण न म्</li>
      <li>झ भ ञ्</li>
      <li>घ ढ ध ष्</li>
      <li>ज ब ग ड द श्</li>
      <li>ख फ छ ठ थ च ट त व्</li>
      <li>क प य्</li>
      <li>श ष स र्</li>
      <li>ह ल</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These 14 sounds became the foundational sūtra-s for Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī. After
      producing his Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini became so famous that there is even a saying – “आकु मारं
      यशः पािणनेः” which means, Pāṇini’s fame reached every child. Why? Because his system
      was so easy. Keep this in mind as you study further. These sūtra-s are known as the
      Māheśvara Sūtra-s or the Śiva Sūtras, because they come from Śiva, who is also known
      as Maheśvara.

    <p>
      So how do you use these Māheśvara Sūtra-s? What are they for? Remember that at
      the time they were written, the style of writing in vogue was sūtra style, which
      prioritized brevity over everything. This was likely to facilitate easy memorization.
      These 14 sūtra-s are therefore used to create “shortcuts” in the form of single syllables to
      refer to many letters at once. If Pāṇini did not come up with these 14 sūtra-s, his
      Aṣṭādhyāyī would have been many times longer than it is, because he would have to
      refer to each letter separately. This will become clear as we learn how to use them below.
      So, let us now see how these Māheśvara Sūtra-s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shortcut like this is called a pratyāhāra in grammar. It is when the first part of the
      first element and the last part of the last element of a list are concatenated into a single
      short string to refer to everything in between them. In the Māheśvara Sūtra-s, you will
      notice certain patterns, and almost random letters at the end of each sūtra. These ending
      letters are: ण्, क्, ङ्, च्, ट्, ण्, म्, ञ्, ष्, श्, व्, य्, र, and ् ल्. These are the letters that will always
      be the ending letter of each pratyāhāra. The beginning letter can be any other letter from
      within the sūtra-s. The letters we refer to with a particular pratyāhāra, then, are all the
      letters beginning with the first one mentioned and ending with the ending letter, not
      including any of the ending letters in your list. That is, the ending letters are only used
      to conclude these pratyāhāra-s, like a cap, but are not intended to be counted in the list of
      letters being referred to. They are only there for the sake of making a pratyāhāra. Let us
      see some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we want to refer to all the vowels. This is the first four Māheśvara sūtra-s:
      अइउण्, ऋऌक्, एओङ्, ऐऔच्. So we will start with अ, and end with च्. And remember that
      when you are creating a pratyāhāra, you do not count the final letters of any sūtra in the
      letters you want to refer to. So our new pratyāhāra is अच्. This refers to the letters अ, इ, उ,
      ऋ, ऌ, ए, ओ, ऐ, and औ. It is a single syllable used to refer to a set of 9 letters. Not only that,
      but remember that the reason there are only nine vowels listed in these sūtra-s is
      because each of these nine contains within it the entire set of savarṇa vowels. Notice
      how none of the final letters (in this case, ण्, क्, ङ्, and च्) were included in the list we
      just made. They are only there to aid us in making these pratyāhāra-s. What about all the
      consonants? These would be referred to by the pratyāhāra हल्. We start with ह, the first
      consonant in the list, and end with ल्, the ending letter of the last sūtra, which includes
      all the consonants: ह य व र ल ञ म ङ ण न झ भ घ ढ ध ज ब ग ड द ख फ छ ठ थ च ट त क प श ष स ह.
      Interestingly, this list starts and ends with ह. This is because sometimes Pāṇini will want
      to include ह with the semivowels in his codification, and sometimes with the sibilants.
      Thus ह is the only letter that appears twice in these sūtra-s. The following is a list of all
      the sūtra-s showing all the pratyāhāra-s that Pāṇini makes with their final letters.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>अ इ उ ण् – the ण् in this sūtra makes one pratyāhāra – अण्.</li>
      <li>ऋ ऌ क् – the क् in this sūtra makes three pratyāhāra-s – अक्; इक्; उक्.</li>
      <li>ए ओ ङ् – the ङ् in this sūtra makes one pratyāhāra – एङ्.</li>
      <li>ऐ औ च् – the च् in this sūtra makes four pratyāhāra-s – अच्; इच्; एच्; ऐच्.</li>
      <li>ह य व र ट् – the ट् in this sūtra makes one pratyāhāra – अट्.</li>
      <li>ल ण् – the ण् in this sūtra makes three pratyāhāra-s – अण्; इण्; यण्.</li>
      <li>ञ म ङ ण न म् – the म् in this sūtra makes three pratyāhāra-s – अम्; ञम्; ङम्.</li>
      <li>झ भ ञ् – the ञ् in this sūtra makes one pratyāhāra – यञ्.</li>
      <li>घ ढ ध ष् – the ष् in this sūtra makes two pratyāhāra-s – भष्; झष्.</li>
      <li>ज ब ग ड द श् – the श् in this sūtra makes six pratyāhāra-s – अश्; हश्; वश्; जश्; झश्; बश्.</li>
      <li>ख फ छ ठ थ च ट त व् – the व् in this sūtra makes one pratyāhāra – छव्.</li>
      <li>क प य् – the य् in this sūtra makes four pratyāhāra-s – यय्; मय्; झय्; खय्; चय्.</li>
      <li>श ष स र – the ् र in this ् sūtra makes five pratyāhāra-s – यर; ् झर; ् खर; ् चर; ् शर.्</li>
      <li>ह ल् – the ल् in this sūtra makes six pratyāhāra-s – अल्; हल्; वल्; रल्; झल्; शल्.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In total, this makes 42 pratyāhāra-s made from the Māheśvara Sūtras and used by Pāṇini
      throughout his Aṣṭādhyāyī. By studying and gaining a proficiency in the use of these
      pratyāhāra-s, one increases fluency and speed in the study of vyākaraṇa. Therefore, it is
      imperative that you study these sūtra-s well before moving forward. Try taking each
      pratyāhāra listed above and see which letters are included within it.
