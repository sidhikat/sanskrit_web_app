      <p >The following concept is a fundamental building block of Sanskrit grammar and its
      codification. Without it, Pāṇini could not have written his Aṣṭādhyāyī the way he did. Its
      origin story is also important to know, so let us start there. The following story is a
      retelling of the story that is told about Pāṇini within the vyākaraṇa tradition.</p>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in a city called Takṣaśilā (modern day: Taxila, Punjab, Pakistan),
        there lived a boy who was a fool. He grew up hearing about his own foolishness and
        that he would never amount to anything. Somehow, he got into the university in
        Takṣaśilā, which was a well-known center of education. There, he studied Sanskrit
        grammar (vyākaraṇa). Even at the university, he was called a fool, and one day he got
        fed up with this designation. He went to the forest to perform austerities and to beseech
        Lord Śiva to bestow intelligence upon him. Śiva was pleased with his austerity, and
        started to dance. While dancing, he played his instrument, the ḍamaru, 14 times. When
        he played his instrument, to a normal ear, it sounded like “takatakatakataka”. But to
        Pāṇini’s ears, which were tuned to the subject of Sanskrit vyākaraṇa, it sounded like:
      </p>

    <ul>
      <li>  अ इ उ ण्</li>
      <li> ऋ ऌ क्</li>
      <li>ए ओ ङ्</li>
      <li>ऐ औ च्</li>
      <li>ह य व र ट्</li>
      <li>ल ण्</li>
      <li>ञ म ङ ण न म्</li>
      <li>झ भ ञ्</li>
      <li>घ ढ ध ष्</li>
      <li>ज ब ग ड द श्</li>
      <li>ख फ छ ठ थ च ट त व्</li>
      <li>क प य्</li>
      <li>श ष स र्</li>
      <li>ह ल</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These 14 sounds became the foundational sūtra-s for Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī. After
      producing his Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini became so famous that there is even a saying – “आकु मारं
      यशः पािणनेः” which means, Pāṇini’s fame reached every child. Why? Because his system
      was so easy. Keep this in mind as you study further. These sūtra-s are known as the
      Māheśvara Sūtra-s or the Śiva Sūtras, because they come from Śiva, who is also known
      as Maheśvara.
