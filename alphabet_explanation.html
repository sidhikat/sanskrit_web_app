      <h5 class="display-4" id="intro">General Introduction</h5>
      <p>Much time can be devoted to studying the Sanskrit alphabet and all its
        features. Here, we will discuss the most relevant features for the study of
        Sanskrit grammar, including its native script, Devanāgarī. The Sanskrit alphabet is
        a set of sounds (technically known as phonemes) that can be put together to form
        spoken words. Its writing system is a collection of visual representations of these
        sounds, arranged into syllables. A “letter” and its sound are not two independent
        entities in Sanskrit. In English, for example, the letter “a” is an independent
        entity that contains within it the potential for multiple sounds, such as the “a” in
        “apple”, “car”, “ace”, or “human”. In Sanskrit, one letter contains only one
        possible phoneme, so there is a one-to-one mapping of sounds and letters in the
        alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
      The script for writing Sanskrit can be any set of squiggly lines on a page, as
      long as it accurately represents all the sounds of the alphabet. For visually
      representing the Sanskrit alphabet, the most common script today is Devanāgarī.
      Note that different languages employ different types of writing systems. The
      Sanskrit writing system is known as a syllabic alphabet, alphasyllabary, or
      abugida. We have generically called it the Sanskrit “alphabet” because that is
      common parlance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the script can be anything, it is still recommended that you learn
        Devanāgarī because most of what is written in Sanskrit today can be found in that
        script. Devanāgarī is not terribly important for representing Sanskrit, considering
        there is no provision in Sanskrit literature for the codification of its script.
        Learning it here is more to give you practice so that when you go out into the
        world of Sanskrit, you can read most of what is written in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, there are several other scripts used to represent Sanskrit
      sounds. An increasingly common script being used to represent the Sanskrit
      alphabet is called IAST, the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration.
      This is the script we have been using so far to write Sanskrit words. IAST is an
      especially important script to learn for Sanskrit, especially if you are learning in
      the medium of English. Therefore, we should also learn that script along with
      Devanāgarī.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now on to the alphabet. A single letter in the Sanskrit alphabet is known as a
      varṇa or akṣara. These can be of two types: vowel (svara) or consonant
      (vyañjana).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="display-4" id="vowels-intro">Vowels - Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      A svara is defined in Sanskrit as svayaṁ rājate iti svarāḥ (Literally, “that which rules
    itself or shines forth by itself is called a svara.”). Those sounds that can exist on their
    own without the help of any other sound are known as svara. Try saying
    “a” (pronounced “uh”) and hold the sound in your mouth. Do you feel how it does not
    need the help of any other sound to exist? On the other hand, try saying the sound “ga”
    and notice that without the help of the “a”, you would not be able to pronounce the
    sound “g”. This is how you can recognize something to be a svara. There are nine svara-s
    in Sanskrit. These are अ (a), इ (i), उ (u), ऋ (ṛ), ऌ (lṛ), ए (e), ओ (o), ऐ (ai), and औ (au). If you
    have studied Sanskrit before and feel that some vowels (such as आ (ā), ई (ī), etc.) are
    missing here, don’t worry: we are getting to that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sanskrit, each vowel has multiple variations depending on how long it is spoken
    for, which pitch it is spoken at, and whether it is nasalized. These variations allow for
    there to be a huge number of vowel pronunciations in Sanskrit. Let us take a look at the
    classifications below.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="display-4" id="duration">Vowels - Duration</h5>
    <p>A vowel can be held for one, two, or more than two “beats” (known as mātrā-s) in
      Sanskrit. Thus a table can be made that looks like the following:
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="vowel_duration.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:60%" alt="Responsive image">
    </div>
    <p>
      As you can see, अ, इ, उ, and ऋ all have all three durations. ऌ only has short and prolated
      forms (according to the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, this is because the long form of
      ऌ is simply never seen anywhere in the Sanskrit corpus). ए, ओ, ऐ, and औ only have long
      and prolated forms, because they are naturally never short.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h5 class="display-4" id="pitch">Vowels - Pitch</h5>
      <p>
        Sanskrit vowels have three pitches. They can be spoken at a high (udātta), low
        (anudātta), or medium (svarita) pitch. The exact frequencies of these pitches are defined
        only relative to each other, and in Vedic chanting they are heard quite distinctly, because
        they are preserved there. Classical Sanskrit in its written and spoken form does not
        preserve pitch differentiation. The high pitch is written with an apostrophe-like mark
        above the vowel, the low pitch is written with an underscore-like mark underneath the
        vowel, and the medium pitch is written without any marker.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="display-4" id="nasal">Vowels - Nasalization</h5>
      <p>
        Sanskrit vowels can be either nasalized (anunāsika) or non-nasalized (ananunāsika).
        Think of this as saying the vowel through your nose, or not, respectively. We might
        write a nasalized अ in very loose transliteration as something like “unh”. The nasalized
        vowel is written with a crescent-like marker (known as a candrabindu) on top, like this:
        अँ.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="display-4" id="conclusion">Vowels - Conclusion</h5>
      <p>
        When we put these together, we see that the first four vowels have 18 forms each (3
        durations, 3 pitches, and 2 nasalizations), and the rest have 12 forms each (2 durations, 3
        pitches, and 2 nasalizations). This is a lot of vowels! But keep in mind, as you go
        forward, that the 18 forms of अ are not considered separate from अ. They are considered
        variations of the same vowel. Thus we may refer to all 18 of them with a single अ. All
        forms of अ are known as the savarṇa letters of अ. Savarṇa literally means “similar
        letter”, or “letter with similar properties”. Hence all 18 forms of अ are savarṇa with each
        other, all 18 forms of इ are savarṇa with each other, and so on. This idea also applies to
        consonants, but in a slightly different way.
