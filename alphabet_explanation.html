      <h5 class="display-4" id="intro">General Introduction</h5>
      <p>Much time can be devoted to studying the Sanskrit alphabet and all its
        features. Here, we will discuss the most relevant features for the study of
        Sanskrit grammar, including its native script, Devanāgarī. The Sanskrit alphabet is
        a set of sounds (technically known as phonemes) that can be put together to form
        spoken words. Its writing system is a collection of visual representations of these
        sounds, arranged into syllables. A “letter” and its sound are not two independent
        entities in Sanskrit. In English, for example, the letter “a” is an independent
        entity that contains within it the potential for multiple sounds, such as the “a” in
        “apple”, “car”, “ace”, or “human”. In Sanskrit, one letter contains only one
        possible phoneme, so there is a one-to-one mapping of sounds and letters in the
        alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
      The script for writing Sanskrit can be any set of squiggly lines on a page, as
      long as it accurately represents all the sounds of the alphabet. For visually
      representing the Sanskrit alphabet, the most common script today is Devanāgarī.
      Note that different languages employ different types of writing systems. The
      Sanskrit writing system is known as a syllabic alphabet, alphasyllabary, or
      abugida. We have generically called it the Sanskrit “alphabet” because that is
      common parlance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the script can be anything, it is still recommended that you learn
        Devanāgarī because most of what is written in Sanskrit today can be found in that
        script. Devanāgarī is not terribly important for representing Sanskrit, considering
        there is no provision in Sanskrit literature for the codification of its script.
        Learning it here is more to give you practice so that when you go out into the
        world of Sanskrit, you can read most of what is written in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, there are several other scripts used to represent Sanskrit
      sounds. An increasingly common script being used to represent the Sanskrit
      alphabet is called IAST, the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration.
      This is the script we have been using so far to write Sanskrit words. IAST is an
      especially important script to learn for Sanskrit, especially if you are learning in
      the medium of English. Therefore, we should also learn that script along with
      Devanāgarī.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now on to the alphabet. A single letter in the Sanskrit alphabet is known as a
      varṇa or akṣara. These can be of two types: vowel (svara) or consonant
      (vyañjana).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="display-4" id="vowels-intro">Vowels - Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      A svara is defined in Sanskrit as svayaṁ rājate iti svarāḥ (Literally, “that which rules
    itself or shines forth by itself is called a svara.”). Those sounds that can exist on their
    own without the help of any other sound are known as svara. Try saying
    “a” (pronounced “uh”) and hold the sound in your mouth. Do you feel how it does not
    need the help of any other sound to exist? On the other hand, try saying the sound “ga”
    and notice that without the help of the “a”, you would not be able to pronounce the
    sound “g”. This is how you can recognize something to be a svara. There are nine svara-s
    in Sanskrit. These are अ (a), इ (i), उ (u), ऋ (ṛ), ऌ (lṛ), ए (e), ओ (o), ऐ (ai), and औ (au). If you
    have studied Sanskrit before and feel that some vowels (such as आ (ā), ई (ī), etc.) are
    missing here, don’t worry: we are getting to that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sanskrit, each vowel has multiple variations depending on how long it is spoken
    for, which pitch it is spoken at, and whether it is nasalized. These variations allow for
    there to be a huge number of vowel pronunciations in Sanskrit. Let us take a look at the
    classifications below.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="display-4" id="duration">Vowels - Duration</h5>
    <p>A vowel can be held for one, two, or more than two “beats” (known as mātrā-s) in
      Sanskrit. Thus a table can be made that looks like the following:
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="vowel_duration.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:60%" alt="Responsive image">
    </div>
    <p>
      As you can see, अ, इ, उ, and ऋ all have all three durations. ऌ only has short and prolated
      forms (according to the Sanskrit grammatical tradition, this is because the long form of
      ऌ is simply never seen anywhere in the Sanskrit corpus). ए, ओ, ऐ, and औ only have long
      and prolated forms, because they are naturally never short.
    </p>
  </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="display-4" id="pitch">Vowels - Pitch</h5>
      <p>
        Sanskrit vowels have three pitches. They can be spoken at a high (udātta), low
        (anudātta), or medium (svarita) pitch. The exact frequencies of these pitches are defined
        only relative to each other, and in Vedic chanting they are heard quite distinctly, because
        they are preserved there. Classical Sanskrit in its written and spoken form does not
        preserve pitch differentiation. The high pitch is written with an apostrophe-like mark
        above the vowel, the low pitch is written with an underscore-like mark underneath the
        vowel, and the medium pitch is written without any marker.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="display-4" id="nasal">Vowels - Nasalization</h5>
      <p>
        Sanskrit vowels can be either nasalized (anunāsika) or non-nasalized (ananunāsika).
        Think of this as saying the vowel through your nose, or not, respectively. We might
        write a nasalized अ in very loose transliteration as something like “unh”. The nasalized
        vowel is written with a crescent-like marker (known as a candrabindu) on top, like this:
        अँ.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="display-4" id="conclusion">Vowels - Conclusion</h5>
      <p>
        When we put these together, we see that the first four vowels have 18 forms each (3
        durations, 3 pitches, and 2 nasalizations), and the rest have 12 forms each (2 durations, 3
        pitches, and 2 nasalizations). This is a lot of vowels! But keep in mind, as you go
        forward, that the 18 forms of अ are not considered separate from अ. They are considered
        variations of the same vowel. Thus we may refer to all 18 of them with a single अ. All
        forms of अ are known as the savarṇa letters of अ. Savarṇa literally means “similar
        letter”, or “letter with similar properties”. Hence all 18 forms of अ are savarṇa with each
        other, all 18 forms of इ are savarṇa with each other, and so on. This idea also applies to
        consonants, but in a slightly different way.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="display-4" id="consonants">Consonants</h5>
      <p>
        A vyañjana is defined in Sanskrit as anvag bhavati vyañjanam (Literally, “that which
      follows an ac (vowel) is called a vyañjana.”). Those sounds that cannot be pronounced
      on their own without the help of another sound are known as vyañjana, and are
      subordinate to svara. There are 33 vyañjana-s in Sanskrit. They are arranged in the tables
      that follow with some more technical terms for easy reference and learning.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="touching_consonants.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:60%" alt="Responsive image">
    </div>
    <p>
      This is a table of the core consonants of Sanskrit, known as sparśa. It has five rows and
      five columns, labeled R1, R2, etc. and C1, C2, etc., respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each row is known as a varga and represents a location in the mouth where
    consonants are made, and moves progressively forward in the mouth. Each location in
    the mouth is known as a sthāna.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>R1 is made in the throat, which is known as the kaṇṭha. These letters are called
      velars or gutturals in English and kaṇṭhya in Sanskrit. R1 is known as the ka-varga
      or simply, ku.</li>
      <li>R2 is made in the soft palate, which is known as the tālu. These letters are called
      palatals in English and tālavya in Sanskrit. R2 is known as the ca-varga or
      simply, cu.</li>
      <li>R3 is made in the hard palate, which is known as the mūrdhan. These letters are
      called cerebrals or retroflex in English and mūrdhanya in Sanskrit. R3 is known
      as the ṭa-varga or simply, ṭu.</li>
      <li>R4 is made in the teeth, which are known as danta. These letters are called
      dentals in English and dantya in Sanskrit. R4 is known as the ta-varga or simply,
      tu.</li>
      <li>R5 is made in the lips, which are known as oṣṭha. These letters are called labials
      in English and oṣṭhya in Sanskrit. R5 is known as the pa-varga or simply, pu.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Notice that there is a shortcut name to refer to each of the rows. These are, ku, cu, ṭu,
      tu, and pu. These shortcuts have a technical name too. They are known as udit. The
      literal meaning of this word is less important right now, and will become clear on its
      own. But know that the word udit is used to refer to any one of these five shortcuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each column represents a particular combination of effort, known as a prayatna. We
      will get into the details of sthāna and prayatna elsewhere. For now, let us talk about the
      columns. Each column is made up of a particular voicing and aspiration. Voicing is
      about whether you must use your voice to say a letter, and aspiration is about how
      much breath you use to say a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To explain voicing, think about whether you can hold your breath and say a letter
      without any voice at all. For example, try saying “k” without using your breath at all,
      and without any vowel sound attached. It is possible, right? You can vaguely make the
      “k” sound without using your voice. Hence, this letter is called unvoiced. Now try the
      same thing with “g”. Can you do it? It is impossible, because you need to use your voice
      to be able to say it. Hence, this letter is called voiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for aspiration, if you position your hand, palm towards you, approximately two
    inches away from your mouth when you say a letter, then if the letter is unaspirated (no
    breath) you should not feel any air on your palm. If it is aspirated (with breath), you
    should feel a rush of air on your palm.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>C1 is made up of unvoiced unaspirated consonants corresponding to the sthāna
        of that row.</li>
      <li>C2 is made up of unvoiced aspirated consonants corresponding to the sthāna of
      that row.</li>
      <li>C3 is made up of voiced unaspirated consonants corresponding to the sthāna of
      that row.</li>
      <li>C4 is made up of voiced aspirated consonants corresponding to the sthāna of that
      row.</li>
      <li>C5 is made up of voiced unaspirated nasal consonants corresponding to the
      sthāna of that row.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Thus each row is made up of one of each of the following types of sounds, produced in
      a single place in the mouth: unvoiced unaspirated, unvoiced aspirated, voiced
      unaspirated, voiced aspirated, and a nasal.<br />
      This is only 25 of the 33 consonants. What about the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us see the semivowels. These are known as antaḥstha and are four in
      number. These are: य (ya), र (ra), ल (la), and व (va). They are called semivowels because
      they have a sort of vowel quality to them but include a light touch in the mouth in order
      to be produced. They are all voiced and unaspirated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next are the sibilants, known as ūṣman, and are three in number. These are: श (śa), ष
      (ṣa), and स (sa). They are called sibilants because they make a hissing sound when they
      are spoken. They are all unvoiced and aspirated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there is the pure aspirate, also part of the ūṣman category. This is: ह (ha). It is
      called the pure aspirate because no other effort is required to produce it other than
      pushing your breath out. It is considered voiced and aspirated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a new table may be prepared, putting the semivowels, sibilants, and pure
      aspirate into their respective locations in the mouth.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="all_consonants.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:60%" alt="Responsive image">
    </div>
    <p>
      Notice that there is a new row here, labeled dantoṣṭha, in order to accommodate व.
      Since व is pronounced using a combination of the teeth and the lips, it is technically
      located in the dantoṣṭha (danta + oṣṭha). Notice also that now the production of all of the
      letters fall into one or the other locations in the mouth. We have yet to add one more
      section to this table: the vowels (yes, they also fall into the same sthāna-s as the rest of
      the letters of the alphabet).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="display-4" id="alphabet">All of the letters of the Alphabet</h5>
    <div>
      <img src="entire_alphabet.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:60%" alt="Responsive image">
    </div>
    <p>
      Here you can see all the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet arranged by type and sthāna.
      Notice the addition of two new rows to accommodate ए, ऐ, ओ, and औ. ए and ऐ are made
      by combining the vowel sounds of the kaṇṭha and the tālu, and thus the place in the
      mouth they are made is called the kaṇṭhatālu. ओ and औ are made by combining the
      vowel sounds of the kaṇṭha and the oṣṭha, and thus the place in the mouth they are made
      is called the kaṇṭhoṣṭha. One more point to note: C5 is also technically located in the
      nāsikā ca, which means “the nose too”. Notice that when you say ङ, ञ, ण, न, and म, you
      are not only pronouncing these sounds in their respective locations in the mouth, you
      are also producing them through your nose, hence this special designation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are an additional two sounds that have not yet been included in our table.
      These are the visarga, symbolized as something resembling a colon following a vowel
      (like अः, इः, etc., or कः, तः, etc.) in devanāgarī and as the symbol ḥ in transliteration; and
      the anusvāra, symbolized as a dot on top of a vowel (like अं, इं, etc., or कं, तं, etc.) in
      devanāgarī and as the symbol ṁ in IAST transliteration. The word visarga literally means
      a release of the breath, which follows any vowel. When you encounter a visarga, release
      your breath while maintaining the shape of the last vowel. The anusvāra is called the
      pure nasal, and is a nasal sound whose pronunciation corresponds to the sthāna of the
      consonant that follows it. It will never occur without a following consonant.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, there are two special sounds that are very rare to see in print, but
    nevertheless are part of the lexicon of Sanskrit phonology, so must be stated here. These
    are the jihvāmūlīya and the upadhmānīya. The jihvāmūlīya is the sound that the visarga
    makes when it is followed by the letters क and ख. It is a half-visarga sound, which is
    symbolized as “X” or “ẖ” in transliteration. To understand its sound, release your
    breath, and while releasing, close your mouth onto the sound क. This is the jihvāmūlīya.
    Similarly, the upadhmānīya is the sound that the visarga makes when it is followed by the
    letters प and फ. It too is a half-visarga sound, which is symbolized as “X” or “ḫ” in
    transliteration. To understand its sound, release your breath, and while releasing, close
    your mouth onto the sound प. It sounds almost like the sound “f”. This is the
    upadhmānīya.<br />
    And those are all the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 class="display-4" id="anupurvi">Ānupūrvī</h5>
    <p>
      One very important concept in the study of Sanskrit is the ānupūrvī. This is the
      breaking up of each word into its constituent individual letters and writing them next to
      each other in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the word राम has four letters in it, and can be written with its ānupūrvī
      like this:
    </p>
    <p>
     र् आ म् अ
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the little mark at the bottom of both consonants. This mark is called the
      avasāna, and indicates a stop, or the removal of the vowel that follows the consonant in
      its naturally written state (note that क by itself consists of क् and अ together). In IAST
      transliteration, each vowel is written separately already. Rāma can be written as r ā m a,
      and it was easy to tell from the original word. But in devanāgarī, sometimes it is not as
      easy to tell. Thus the practice of ānupūrvī is extremely important when studying
      Sanskrit. Soon, it will be second nature to you, and you will not need to worry about it.
      But as you start out, practice doing it to every Sanskrit word you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the practice of ānupūrvī for? In Sanskrit grammar, you will find that many of
      the operations you perform between a root and a suffix (or any two operating reactants)
      are only performed on a localized set of letters. For example, when combining the root
      nī with the suffix tṛc, even though we talk about combining an entire root with an entire
      suffix, the truth is, the letter we operate on is only the ī in nī, so it looks like this: nī + tṛc,
      and finally the change that occurs is ne + tṛc. As you can see, only one letter was
      operated on. Now let us see it in devanāgarī: नी + तृच् —> ने + तृच्. If we don’t do the
      ānupūrvī, we won’t be able to separate out the letters clearly enough to understand what
      is being operated on. So we write it instead like this: न्इ + त्ऋ च्. Now it is as clear as the
      IAST script. The importance of this practice cannot be overstated when entering into the
      field of Sanskrit grammar.
